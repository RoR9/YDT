1) You need to make a landing page. Main focus is on desktop resolution. The page should look just OK on other resolutions - without horizontal scroll and blocks that do not fit the width of the page.
2) When you hover over the links in the header, the color should be changed as on the link "Home"
3) “Search” form on the main screen is not necessary to be done
4) When you click on the plus on the "Best Seller Product" section the basket counter in the header should work (increment)
5) When hovering over the image on the "Interior Plant Reference" section, the hover should work as is shown on "living room"
6) The "How to care for plants" department is not necessary!
7) You can use any technology / tools
8) First of all, the quality of the code will be taken into account. If some sections isn’t done in the allotted time, send us what you managed to do
9) Upload your code to GitHub Pages (https://pages.github.com/)
10) Good luck! :)
